    "To install CPTAC, we will use the `cptac` package. CPTAC, which stands for Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium, is a bit like TCGA in that it is publicly available big data for many different cancer but it focuses mostly on proteomics and proteogenomic data. One cool thing about CPTAC is that its proteomics data is *in conjunction* with TCGA clinical data, so CPTAC and TCGA share patients and we can extract more about their protein expression as an added layer of analysis using CPTAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about proteomic data is that it doesn't use absolute counts like RNA data. Instead, proteomics data shows the **relative expression/intensity** instead of counts. This makes it easier to compare protein expression data among different groups/demographics of interest because we have a reference value. \n",
